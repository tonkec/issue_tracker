# Teaching myself React query

This is a sample project from one [course](https://ui.dev/) I really like.

## Why did I decided to learn react-query?

I heard only good things about it and I wanted to see what is all the buzz about.

## What do I plan to do with it?

I plan to build an app using react-query, react, ts and tailwind. I can't wait!
